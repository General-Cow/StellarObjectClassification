# Stellar Object Classification with the SDSS 17 Dataset.
Stellar object are naturally occuring physical entities within the physical universe. They can be a broad array of different entities with markedly different physical characteristics. In this analysis, I focus on three types: Galaxies, Stars, and Quasi-Stellar Objects (also known as quasars or QSOs).

Stars are object similar to our own Sun, although they have quite a broad array of different types with different characteristics. They are spheres of plasma held together by gravity. Galaxies are objects like our very own Milky Way, although like stars, there are a broad array of different types. Galaxies are collections of stars, gas, dust, dark matter, and various other entities held together through gravity. Very commonly there will be a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. Finally, quasars are extremely luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). This means that we have a supermassive black hole in which the amount of matter falling into it is enough that the black hole is heated up enough to emit immense amounts of radiation in a beam from the accretion disk. Each of these objects have unique spectroscopic results allowing researchers to determine the type of object that they are and allow for further study of these objects.

As such classifying these objects is a matter of critical importance for futher study and data science has tools that will allow us to do precisely that. In particular, EDA techniques can allow a deeper understanding of the differences in these datasets and machine learning classification tools can be used to automate the classification of large volumes of data such as those collected by future sky surveys by the SDSS teams.

I will be conducting EDA of the data to explore what we can learn from the dataset itself and conducting machine learning to see if we can develop a useful classifier for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 17 data.

On a personal level, this project was about combining my current passion and profession, data science, and a rekindling of previous passion and profession, astrophysics. I would like to continue applying my skills in data science to the field of astrophysics and this project serves as a first step back into the field for me.
